## 1) ```catmodeling```: Various Routines for Processing Catastrophe Modeling ELTs and YLTs

> ```catmodeling``` is an R library that contains various 
catastrophe modelling tools, including routines for 
(a) simulating YLTs; 
(b) simulating adjusted YLTs using incremental simulation, a novel simulation method that reduces simulation noise; 
(c) reducing the length of YLTs while still giving a good approximation to the AEP losses; 
(d) adjusting ELTs using historical losses; 
(e) analyzing catXL contracts. 


## 2) Major tools included in ```catmodeling```

The major tools included in ```catmodeling``` are:

1. ```yltsim```: simulates a YLT from an ELT using Poisson simulation, with
or without secondary uncertainty.

2. ```yltsim_inc```: simulates an adjusted YLT using incremental simulation,
a method that reduces simulation noise.

3. ```yltreduce```: reduces the length of a YLT while still giving a good
approximation to the AEP losses

4. ```eltmerge```: adjusts a model ELT using a short historical ELT, so that
the model losses move closer to the historical losses.

5. ```catxl```: applies a CatXL tower to a YLT and generates various
outputs.

These tools are documented in more detail below.

## 3) Minor tools included in ```catmodeling```

The minor tools included in ```catmodeling``` are:

1. ```calcbeta```: calculates the parameters of beta distributions from the mean 
and standard deviation.

2. ```calcelt```: calculates some simple diagnostics from an ELT.

3. ```calcylt```: calculates some simple diagnostics from a YLT.

4. ```rate_adjustments_cat_to_event```: applies cat-by-cat rate adjustments to an ELT,
to produce a new ELT. 

5. ```make_cep_rps```: calculates CEP return periods for events in an ELT.

6. ```convertrp2index```: converts return periods to event index in an ELT.

7. ```eltmerge_plotone```: makes a single plot using results from ```eltmerge```

8. ```eltmerge_plot```: makes a multiplot using results from ```eltmerge```

9. ```eltmerge_stats```: prints various diagnostics from ```eltmerge``` to the screen

## 4) ```yltsim```

```yltsim``` simulates a YLT from an ELT using Poisson simulation, with
or without secondary uncertainty.


The simplest use of ```yltsim``` is as follows:

1. Set up a data frame ```elt``` with the columns ```mrate``` and ```mloss```
2. Call ```yltsim``` using ```ylt=yltsim(nyears, elt)```
3. ```ylt``` is a dataframe that contains the simulated YLT.

The simulated YLT is stored as two objects:

1. ```ylt$longylt```, in which every row is a simulated event

2. ```ylt$shortylt```, in which every row is a simulated year, with summary information for that year

```yltsim``` also includes the following functionality:

1. The ```verbose``` flag controls whether anything is output to the screen during simulation.

2. The ```secuncb``` flag specifies whether secondary uncertainty is required. 
For secondary uncertainty to work, the input ELT must contain the additional
columns ```sloss``` and ```expo```.

3. Columns in the ELT with the following headings will be propagated into the YLT:
	+ ```evid```
	+ ```wspd``` (windspeed, intended as landfall windspeed)
	+ ```lflat``` (landfall latitude)
	+ ```lflon``` (landfall longitude)
	+ ```lfreg``` (landfall region)

The additional columns can be used to story any data whatsoever, since the data is not
used by ```yltsim```, only copied.

## 5) ```yltsim_inc```

Imagine you are planning to simulate a YLT from an ELT, adjust the
ELT, resimulate the YLT, and compare the two YLTs.
This process is subject to simulation noise: even if the ELT is not adjusted
then the two YLTs will be different.

```yltsim_inc``` gives a way to simulate the second YLT while greatly 
reducing the simulation noise. It does that using the *incremental simulation*
algorithm (Jewson, 2023).

The simplest use of ```yltsim_inc``` is as follows:

1. Set up a data frame ```elt``` with the columns ```mrate``` and ```mloss```
2. Call ```yltsim``` using ```ylt1=yltsim(nyears, elt)```
3. Set up desired rates adjustments in ```rate_adjustments_by_event```
4. Call ```yltsim_inc``` using ```ylt2=yltsim_inc(nyears,elt,ylt1)```
5. ```ylt2``` is a dataframe that contains the adjusted YLT

The rate adjustments can either be constant, or log-normally distributed.
Using log-normally distributed rate adjustments allows for uncertainty
in the adjustments, and the code uses the *stochastic
parameter* simulation method, in which the rate adjustments are varied
from year to year (Jewson, 2022).

As with ```yltsim```, ```yltsim_inc``` also supports the flags
```verbose``` and ```secuncb```.

## 6) ```yltreduce```

```yltreduce``` takes a YLT and deletes years to produce a YLT with fewer years.
The years are deleted in such a way that the annual loss distribution
remains as close as possible to the original annual loss distribution.

One use-case would be to simulate a YLT with 100,000 years, and then 
use ```yltreduce``` to reduce the length of that YLT to 10,000 years in order
to fit into software tools that require 10,000 year YLTs.
The 10,000 year YLT generated in this way would be much less affected
by simulation noise than a 10,000 year YLT simulated directly from scratch.


The simplest use of ```yltsim_inc``` is as follows:

1. Create the original YLT, ```big_ylt```

2. Call ```yltreduce``` using ```small_ylt=yltreduce(nyears_reduced, big_ylt)```

```yltreduce``` also includes the following functionality:

1. The ```verbose``` flag controls whether anything is output to the screen 

2. The ```plotflag``` makes some plots (mainly for debugging purposes)

## 7) ```eltmerge```

Imagine you have model results which do not match historical losses
at short return periods. If you believe the historical losses more than you
believe the model results then you might want to adjust the model losses
to move them towards the historical losses. That is what ```eltmerge``` does.
It returns a new ELT with the same events as the original model ELT,
but with new losses for the short return period events.
It also produces plots that illustrate the historical, model and 
adjusted CEPs.

```eltmerge``` can be used as follows:

1. Create the model and historical ELTs (```modelloss``` and ```histloss```)

2. Call ```newelt=eltmerge(nyhist, histloss, nymodel, modelloss, weightw)```
where ```nyhist``` is the number of years represented in the model, 
and ```nymodel``` is the number of years represented in the historical data.

3. ```newelt``` is the new adjusted ELT.

For very short return periods ```eltmerge``` puts almost all the weight
onto the historical losses. 
For the longest historical return the weight that ```eltmerge``` puts
onto the historical losses is specified using ```weightw```.

## 8) ```catxl```

```catxl``` applies a CatXL tower to a YLT.
It accounts for any number of reinstatements.
It calculates various outputs for the CatXL layers, including premium 
based on a percentage principle.

To use ```catxl```:

1. Create the YLT, and vectors that specify the limits, deductibles and the
number of reinstatements by layer. 

2. Call ```catxl``` using ```catxlresults=catxl(ylt, limit, deductible, nrst, premium, rst_premium_pc)```
where ```premium``` is the overall premium, and ```rst_premium_pc``` are the
layer premiums specified as percentages. The two input premiums can both be set 
to zero if premium calculations are not required. 

3. ```catxlresults``` then contains 3 data frames. 
+ ```summary``` gives annual average premiums by layer
+ ```shortrecord``` gives diagnostics by year 
+ ```longrecord``` gives diagnostics by event (i.e., by claim), and can be used
to track the entire calculation applied to every event and layer.
